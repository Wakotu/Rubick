# Rubick

Rubick is an automata-based fuzz driver generation prototype. It is published in the [work published in Usenix Security 2023](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/zhangcen).

This repository contains both the source code and the setting used in evaluation of Rubick. For more usage, please see the README.md in each sub-directory.
